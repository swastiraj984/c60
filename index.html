            My hobby is reading. I read storybooks, magazines, newspapers and any kind of material that I find interesting.
                
Books provide the reader with many information and facts in his life.
                <br>
                <br>
                Books have definitely helped me a lot in my life.Today, I can find a solution to every problem in a normal way. Otherwise, I used to think of learning things in a weird way before. Actually it is an activity that we do in our free time. It is my favorite business.This hobby started when I was a little girl. I always wanted my parents to read fairy tales and other stories near me and tell me.
                
In a few days, my family got upset after reading the stories and then they inspired me to read on their own.So I started trying to read, I learned to read. I first started with the simple language ABC books. Soon I started being able to read simple fairy tales and other stories. Now I can easily read any available books, newspapers etc.
